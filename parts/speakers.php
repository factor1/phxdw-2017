			<p>Since 2009, the Method + Madness Conference has brought together the Arizona design community for a weekend of actionable insights, hands­-on education, and career ­fueling inspiration. It’s the two-­day highlight of Phoenix Design Week and a fantastic opportunity to connect with other designers and creative professionals.</p>
