# Offsets
Ginger has offset classes that are useful for offsetting columns in a row. For
instance if you want to offset an element by 2 columns you would just apply a class
of `offset-2`. Offset classes only apply to the medium and large viewports.

## Usage Example

```html
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-3 offset-3">
    <!-- Offset Column by 3 -->
  </div>
</div>
```
